// Example 1:

// Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
// Output: 6
// Explanation: 
// - In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
// - In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
// The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.
// Example 2:

// Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
// Output: 8
// Explanation:
// - In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
// - In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
// The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.
